# **App Name**: ExpenseWise

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Users can create accounts and securely log in/log out.
- Group Management: Users can create groups and invite other users to join. Each group has a name and a list of members.
- Expense Tracking: Users can add expenses to a group, including description, amount, payer, participants, date, and an optional receipt image. Support splitting expenses equally or unequally.
- Smart Receipt Parsing: Use an AI tool to analyze receipts and automatically fill in expense details such as amount, date, and merchant. The user should review and confirm the pre-filled information.
- Balance Calculation & Settlement: Calculate and display balances between group members, showing who owes whom. Allow users to record settlements and mark payments as done.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Green (#4CAF50) to represent balance and money.
- Secondary color: Light Gray (#F5F5F5) for backgrounds and neutral elements.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for groups, expenses, and balances.
- Use recognizable icons for categories, actions, and user profiles.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance user experience.
